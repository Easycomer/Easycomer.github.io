<div>
<p><b>Thank you for running GPSLogger_FHWA!</b></p>
<p> GPSLogger_FHWA is an app partly developed by the researchers in the University of Wisconsin, Madison. It is a part of a larger project aiming at harnessing mobile Ad Hoc networks to improve vulnerable road user safety. </p>
</div>
<p>In our project, we aim to develop a smartphone app to collect movement data from different road users to feed into our following tasks. The collected data will allow for developing the movement models for pedestrians and predict vehicle behavior at intersections. Before you can use our app, we have obtained approval from the Institutional Review Board(IRB) at our university covering the data collection from pedestrians, vehicles, and cyclists. The data will be anonymized without any personally identifiable information stored. Also, the data will be processed locally by the researchers and will not be shared with any third-party entity. Below, we describe the exact data that we collect and to be uploaded to our server.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: #aa0000;"> Privacy Policy </span></span></p>
<p>This privacy policy sets out how the researchers at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department in the University of Wisconsin-Madison, including professors, students, research assistants, visiting scholars and staff, uses and protects any information that you upload when you use GPSLogger_FHWA (this app). We may change this policy from time to time by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy is effective from 12th of March, 2019.</p>
<p><span style="color: #aa0000;"> What we collect </span></p>
<p>We collect the following information:</p>
<p><i>Location Information and Sensor Data Collection:</i></p>
We collect the location information and sensor data after you click start logging button on the main screen. After you start logging, the app will run in the background and collect your location information and sensor data. When you stop for a long time, the app will reduce collecting frequency in order to save your battery. It is worth noting that you can stop logging anytime when you click stop. In particular, we record the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The time GPSLogger_FHWA collected the location and sensor data(timestamp) </li>
<li>The GPS location information includes but not limited to latitude, longitude, and accuracy</li>
<li>The device serial number (device_name)</li>
<li>The sensor data available on your phone, including but not limited to accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation, light, and proximity</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Record Format:</i></p>
<p>Every record we log has the following format: (The data we collect is nothing else than a long list of the records shown below)</p>
<p><span style="color: #7a4707;">time,lat_sensor,lon_values,accuracy,activity<br />
	<p><span style="color: #7a4707;">timestamp, sensor type, sensor value<br />
</span><br />
This is how would a record look like for user at a location of which latitude is 44.071974 and longtitude is -88.397269. The user is on foot and the gps accuracy is 4.288 meter. At this moment, the accelerometer value are 2.1783752, 4.0943604 and 10.522156 for x, y, z axis of smartphone respectively. </p>

<p><span style="color: #7a4707;">18241493135210, 1, [2.1783752, 4.0943604, 10.522156]</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #aa0000;">What we do with the information we gather </span><br />
We require this information to perform our research study as described above. We won&#8217;t be able to locate your home location, work location, points of interest, or places you frequently visit in general since you can choose where to start logging and we only focus on walking activity. Also, we only use phone serial number to distinguish different user and this won&#8217;t be associated with your identity. The location information and sensor data will be sampled at high frequency from the device.</p>
<p>Our app will only upload your compressed and encrypted data to our AWS server and delete the collected data file immediately after uploading. Once we receive the information, we keep it at our servers, and we don&#8217;t share it with any third-party entity. GPSLogger_FHWA never engages with any communication with any external entity and doesn&#8217;t leak any type of information. As part of our development, we could have used third-party libraries to perform some functionalities, but they don&#8217;t collect or communicate any information to third-party servers.
<p>To be able to perform our study and analysis, we have to store the data at our servers for possibly an indefinite amount of time. We might also use the same data for future research projects. However, we will not share your data with any third-party entity without your clear consent. Currently, we don&#8217;t have any plans to share the data with any third party.</p>

<p><span style="color: #aa0000; line-height: 1.5em;">SecurityÂ </span></p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. The collected data will be compressed first and encrypted using <b>AES/RSA</b> encryption to keep it safe. In the uploading part, it will be transmitted under https protocol and saved in AWS server. In particular, only researchers engaged with this project have access to your information.</p>
<p><span style="color: #aa0000;"> Controlling your personal information </span></p>
<p>If there is a situation when/where you feel uncomfortable with GPSLogger_FHWA recording your location information or sensor data, you have the option to stop GPSLogger_FHWA. GPSLogger_FHWA has a &#8220;stop&#8221; button that will cease all data collection unless you run it again. Please note that GPSLogger_FHWA runs only after you open our app and click &#8220;start logging&#8221; button. </p>
